Coding Exercise - Queue
Note: I recommend you work on this exercise while watching the next video - it will walk you through a solution!

Create a queue data structure.

The queue should be a class with methods 'add' and 'remove'

Adding to the queue should store an element until it is removed

Example

const q = new Queue();
q.add(1);
q.remove(); // returns 1;
